The snakes and ladders game coded in Java, has a simple GUI which shows the unit movements only.

There are two classes, player and game. The game class contains the working of the code while the player class just represents a player.

Instances of the player class are in the game class.

The won() function of the game class is called till a winner arises. This is done in the main class.

Tests are added for the won function, the diceroll function and the main function.
